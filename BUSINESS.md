# Marble Business Strategy 🚀

## The Opportunity

The "second brain" and knowledge management market is exploding:
- **Notion**: $10B+ valuation
- **Miro**: $17.5B valuation  
- **Figma**: $20B acquisition by Adobe
- **Obsidian**: Millions of users, sustainable business

**Gap in market**: No one is doing spatial/canvas-based knowledge management beautifully with a consumer focus.
